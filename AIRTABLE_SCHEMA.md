# ProductNova CRM — Airtable Schema Reference

This documents the **live** Airtable base already created and used by this
app. Netlify Functions reference the exact table IDs and field names below —
if you ever rename a field in Airtable, update the corresponding function(s)
in `netlify/functions/` to match.

**Base ID:** `app4hkkQMCZGBwGGk`
**Base URL:** `https://airtable.com/app4hkkQMCZGBwGGk`

| Call Outcome | Single select | Connected, DNP — set only on `Call` activities (drives calls-connected / DNP metrics) |
| Is Follow-Up | Checkbox | set on `Call` or `Email` activities that are follow-ups (drives follow-up call/email metrics) |
| Email Event | Single select | Sent, Opened, Replied — set on `Email` activities. Opens/replies are logged as **separate** activity records (not edits), since Team users can't edit records |

### Performance metrics (Team Performance page)

The `/performance` page aggregates per team member (by `Owner` on Leads and
`Logged By` on Activities) over a selectable day/week/month window:

1. **Leads sourced** — Leads with `Created Date` in range · target = 30 × working days (Mon–Fri)
2. **Appointments set** — Activities of type `Meeting` · target = monthly 10 pro-rated by working days (~2–3/week)
3. **Calls made** — Activities of type `Call` · target = 30 × working days (call each sourced lead)
4. **Calls connected** — `Call` + Call Outcome = Connected
5. **DNPs** — `Call` + Call Outcome = DNP
6. **Follow-up calls** — `Call` + Is Follow-Up
7. **Emails sent** — `Email` + Email Event = Sent (blank event treated as Sent) · target = 30 × working days

### Pace-based scoreboard (Team Performance page)

The Performance page shows a per-rep **scoreboard** above the full metric
table. For the four targeted metrics (leads, calls, emails, appointments) each
progress bar's fill = actual ÷ full-range target, and a tick marks
"expected by today" = target × (`elapsedWorkingDays` ÷ `workingDays`). Bar
colour reflects **pace** (actual ÷ expected-to-date): green ≥95%, amber ≥75%,
red below. `performance-summary.js` returns `elapsedWorkingDays` alongside
`workingDays` to drive this. Access is unchanged: admins see every rep, a team
member sees only their own card (server-enforced).

> Not yet tracked as targets: **monthly conversions (2–3)** and **$ ticket /
> pipeline size ($10K min, $30–50K viable)**. These need new lead fields (a
> won/conversion flag + a deal value) before they can join the scoreboard —
> see SESSION_LOG_2026-07-22.md follow-ups.
8. **Emails opened** — `Email` + Email Event = Opened
9. **Follow-up emails** — `Email` (Sent) + Is Follow-Up
10. **Email replies** — `Email` + Email Event = Replied

Access: Admin/Super Admin see all members; a Team member sees only their own row (enforced server-side).

## Funnel Stage order (used across the app)

`New Lead → Contacted → Qualified → Demo / Meeting → Proposal → Negotiation → Closed Won / Closed Lost`, plus the parallel state `Nurture`.

**Nurture** is just a Funnel Stage value — the CRM never sends emails. An
external automation (outside this app) watches Airtable for Nurture-stage
records and runs email drips elsewhere. A lead can be moved back out of
Nurture into an active stage at any time from the Lead Detail edit form —
by Admin/Super Admin on any lead, or by a Team member on a lead they own
(as of 22 Jul 2026 Team may edit Funnel Stage / Notes / Email / Phone on
their own leads; see SESSION_LOG_2026-07-22.md).

## Recreating this schema from scratch (if you ever need a second base)

1. Create a new Airtable base, e.g. "ProductNova CRM".
2. Create table **Companies** with fields: `Company Name` (primary text),
   `Industry` (text), `Website` (URL), `Size` (text). Add `Linked Leads` and
   `Linked Deals` link fields *after* creating Leads/Deals (Airtable will
   offer to auto-create the reverse link).
3. Create table **Leads** with fields: `Full Name` (primary text), `Email`
   (email), `Phone` (phone), `Company` (link → Companies), `Lead Source`
   (single select with the 7 options above), `Source / Campaign Detail`
   (text), `Funnel Stage` (single select with the 9 options above), `Owner`
   (text), `Notes` (long text), `Created Date` (date+time), `Last Activity
   Date` (date+time), `Lost Reason` (text).
4. Create table **Deals** with fields: `Deal Name` (primary text), `Linked
   Lead` (link → Leads), `Linked Company` (link → Companies), `Deal Value`
   (currency, ₹ symbol), `Expected Close Date` (date), `Probability %`
   (percent), `Stage` (single select, 8 options excluding Nurture), `Owner`
   (text).
5. Create table **Activities** with fields: `Summary` (primary, long text),
   `Linked Lead` (link → Leads), `Activity Type` (single select: Call,
   Email, Meeting, Note), `Date` (date+time), `Logged By` (text).
6. Go back to **Companies** and add `Linked Leads` / `Linked Deals` link
   fields if Airtable didn't create them automatically as reverse links.
7. Grab the new base ID from the API docs (Airtable → Help → API
   documentation, or the base URL) and update `AIRTABLE_BASE_ID` in your
   environment variables. Update the table IDs in
   `netlify/functions/utils/airtable.js`'s `TABLES` object to match.
